# Vane's Bookish API Frontend 📚

I've built my first **API** using **Node in Express** and I built a **Frontend** to show the results! 💥 It has been a great learning experience going through the whole process of building both the Frontend and the Backend for this app 💪👩‍💻 This is a multi-page **React App using React Router, useState hooks and JavaScript fetches**.

## How I built it - What I learned

After the API part was done, I decided to freshen up my React Router skills and create this multi-page app to show the results from the different endpoints.

- The Home page shows the main results: showing the whole list of all the books in the database. This is manageable since I implemented Pagination on my API, which lowers the amounts of books shown per page to 50 and you can move back and forth through the list with buttons on the home page.
- There is a Search Page which I am very proud of, where users can search for books by a specific author.
- The rest of the sections will show the results from the different filters I created in the Backend: Top Rated, Quick Reads, Recommendations.
- This app also includes a section dedicated to the API's documentation with further details on how it works.
