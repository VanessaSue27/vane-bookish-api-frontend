      <h1>Bookish API Documentation:</h1>
      <p>
        Vane&apos;s Bookish API is organized around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST</a>.
        Right now it only performs GET requests in order to show different book
        listings based on a filter and the responses are sent in <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON</a> format.
      </p>

      <p>The different endpoints are easily testable via browser or we also recommend using <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a>.</p>

      <p>There is only one version of Bookish API released so far.</p>

      <h2>ERRORS:</h2>
      <p>
        The most common error that might come up is a 404, especially in the situation
        when a book ID or Author Name can&apos;t be matched.
      </p>
      <p>An error message has been included to help indicate what went wrong.</p>

      <h2>PAGINATION:</h2>
      <p className="example-pagination"><span style={{ marginRight: 7, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Example URL:</span> https://vane-bookish-api.herokuapp.com/books?p=1</p>
      <p>
        Our dataset is made up of 500 different book entries. We have implemented pagination
        in order for the information to be more easily navigated. Each page will display 50
        books at a time. You can access the different pages by adding a <span style={{ color: '#76323f', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>/books?p=1 </span>
        query to the base URL as shown on the example path above.
      </p>

      <h3 className="base-url">Base URL:</h3>
      <h4 className="base-url-link">https://vane-bookish-api.herokuapp.com/</h4>
